*What is Angular: 

*technology must know 
html,css,bootstrap,javascript,typescript
*software pre-requisit 
-nodejs
node -v  //display node version
-npm
npm -v //display npm version
-typescript 
npm install -g typescript // to install typescript 
tsc -v      // display typescript version

*how to install angular 
npm install -g @angular/cli 
ng version      //display angular version 

*explain folder structure 
*what is component : component is partial part of angulae which we can reuse multiple time , 
how to create component

ng generate component componentname
ng generate component components/databinding
ng generate component components/directive

*how to display component output by writting its selector name.

*Databinding : in this we can access data from one file to another (html <=> ts)
1.Interpolation {{}} : ts => html  
2.property []: ts => html (here we set attribute)
3.event binding (): html => ts 
4.two-way databinding [()]: ts <=>html :to perform two way databinding we use ngModel directory , but ngModel directory is not part of core angular it is part of FormsModule , first we have to import FormsModule then we can use ngModel directory.

ng g c Task/toggleimg 

*How to access images and multimedia file 
*how to access constant data 

*directive : it is use to chnage DOM element layout as well as change appearance and behavior of it.
from angular 18 to use directive first we have to import CommanModule in component.

1.Structural Directives :-it is use to change DOM element layout.
                         -Structural directive denoted by astric symbol(*).
                         -*ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase 
                         -we can use single directive to a single DOM element.

2.Attribute Directives: it is use to change appearance and behavior of DOM element.
                       -here we use ngStyle and ngClass.
                       ngStyle: it is use to apply css property condition.
                       ngClass: it is use to apply css class condition.

3.custome Directive : directice developed by developer.

ng-template directive : ngtemplate directive disply DOM element on the basis condition only.


Task: in task folder you have create component with name selectCourse in this there will be two list 
      FrontEnd Course.   2.Backend Course.

*how to use bootstrap in angular 
use bootstrap by downloadind 
step1:npm i bootstrap
step2: go to angular.json file and import its in style array
step3: restart angular project 

*Pipe : in angular pipe will tranform property with chanaging its orinal value.
       -in angular pipe is denoted by | 
       to use it import CommanModule in respexctive component
       there are three types of pipe 
       1.inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular 
       2.custome pipe : pipe developed by developer 
       3.thiredparty pipe: pipe already developed by thiredparty vender which we need to install it first and then use it.

Task directive:pravin,ancilla,nithya

*to display date time javascript first we have to object of data class 
*how to create custome pipe 
ng generate pipe pipename 

ng g pipe shared/cutomePipe/mycube
ng g pipe shared/cutomePipe/mygender

Task:  generate a pipe with name mysquare which will reqturn square of any number
Task:  generate a pipe with name areaofcircle which will reqturn areaofcircle of any number

*component Interaction : fetching data from one component to another.
                        -to fetch data from one component to another they must parent child relation.
                       -to make parent child reation inbetween component we have wtite child component selector as tag in parent component html file.

*Input() decorator : get data from parent component to child
*Output() decorator: get data from child component to parent

*Routing : navigation of component to display its view or output by writting component routing path name in browser url.
-in angular to perform routing we have root routing file with app.routing.ts 
-routing contain array of object 
-we get output or view of all routing component under router-outlet directory

1.naming routing: write path name in browser url to display component output
2.default routing: display component output when path is blanck.
3.re-direct routing: when we have to diplay component output by writting diffrent path name  
4.parameterize routing:display component output only parameter will passwith routing path.
5.child routing : defining one routing inside another routing.
                   -to display output of child routing component we have add router-outlet directory in parent component html file.

6.wild card routing(**): when user enter wrong path it will display component output.
                        -wild card routing must be last routing, if we define routing bello to it, it will never work.

create component with name nav,footer,login,maindashboard,pagenotfound inside layout folder
ng g c layout/nav

create component with name udtdf , rtf ,angForm in angularForm folder
ng g c angularForm/utdf

*Form Validation In Angular 
-thee are two ways to perform form vation in angular 
-to perform form validation we have to import FormsModule in component.

1.UDTF(User Template Driven Form):
-when we have simple and small validation form in that case we it.
-in this validation code will reside in html file 
-here we use ngForm

2.RTF(React Template):
 -when you need to write complex validation for form 
 -in this validation will reside in ts file 
 -to perform we have import ReactiveFormModule from angular form 
 -in this we use two class 1.FormGroup class, 2.FormControl 
 1.FormGroup : it hold data for all form control
 2.FormControl : it track status and hold value of individual input control 


visited input control       ng-untouched       ng-touched
chnage input control value  ng-pristine       ng-dirty 
formcontrol empty          invlid            valid

screen width >= 992px   lg
screen width >= 768px   md 
screen width >= 576px   sm 



grid : here we use two classes .row, .col 
      -in grid row we can create columan with 12 size.

In Utdf 
-password
-email
-term 


*RTF : 
-first import ReactiveFormModule from angular forms library.

FormGroup Class : it will hold status and data of all form control 
FormControl class : it will hold status and value of individual input control 

*Services : in angular Service is reusable code which we can inject in any component if it required.
           -it is nothing but class with extra power
           -we can share data from server to multiple component
           -we can write bussiness logic in it. 
           -we can perform external communication(we can connect with database by calling api)

-how to create 
ng generate service serviceName

ng g service shared/services/myservice


DI(dependency Injection) : it is patter or mechanism to insert code in another component.

create component with name serverData in component and display it output on browser.
ng g c components/serviceData

*create new service 
ng g service shared/services/dbService

*to make http request from service to server first we have to create instance of
